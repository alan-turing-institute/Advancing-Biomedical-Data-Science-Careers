## Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards

Five projects are funded through the MRC Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards to explore and provide evidence on how evidence to improve how
biomedical research includes, resources and recognises, high-quality data science.
The five funded projects part of the award are:

## [ABDC](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/advancing-biomedical-data-science-careers) - Advancing Biomedical Data Science Careers 
- **Led by**: The Alan Turing Institute and EMBL-EBI

- **Aim**:To document a broad range of interdisciplinary biomedical data science to better understand skills, roles, career pathways and team science approaches.
  
- **Goals**:
  - To evaluate skills gaps and identify priority areas for developing knowledge, skills and behaviours across the biomedical data science ecosystem.
  - To better understand roles, career pathways and team science approaches within the biomedical data science community and how these can improve
    access, resourcing and career offers.
  - To evaluate and recommend innovative approaches and ways of working that will  drive forward capacity building and improve quality and standards
    in biomedical data science. 
  
## [BIOMEDASA](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computational-biology-facility/biomedasa/) - Biomedical Data Science Accelerator  
- **Led by**: University of Liverpool 

- **Aim**: Make data science in biomedical research more inclusive, accessible, and impactful.

- **5 projects pillars**: 
  - Enhance: Embedding Research Training Professionals (RTPs) into NHS clinical teams, helping bridge the gap between data and care. 
  - Nurture: Creating short, accessible training sessions and events, in order to help people with little or no background in data science gain practical skills and confidence. 
  - Analyse: Reviewing Biomedical data science MSc programmes across the UK to investigate both barriers and opportunities in accessing further education.  
  - Reskill: For those seeking to switch carers and retrain in data science, they project offers mentorship opportunities and training bursaries, to better help retrain them.  
  - Inspire: Promoting data science careers to secondary school students, though hands-on and interactive programming workshops, involving LEGO robots and micro:bits.  

## [HxC](https://www.ukdri.ac.uk/hxc-healthier-science-through-collaboration) – Healthier Science through Collaboration 
- **Led by**: University of Edinburgh, HDR-UK, UKDRI 

- **Aim**: Amplify the voices of interdisciplinary scientists from diverse backgrounds, with the goal of fostering positive and sustainable culture
  change by embedding good practices within research teams and organisations.

- **Goals**: 
  - Give voice to interdisciplinary scientists from all backgrounds who feel let down
  - Draw from insights of researchers, industry, patient and public representatives to challenge longstanding issues in interdisciplinary research culture
  - Develop evidence-based guidelines to improve this culture
  - Test these draft guidelines in teams from partner institutions UK DRI and Health Data Research UK
  - Integrate good research culture practices to maximise the future impact of UK biomedical data research
  - With an oversight group, early career researchers and Public and Patient Involvement and Industry Group.
  - They have a survey to collect experiences of interdisciplinary collaboration and barriers.

## [INTEGRATE](https://integrate-bio.org/) – Connecting People for Interdisciplinary Research
- **Led by**: University of Oxford
  
- **Aim**: Provide evidence to higher education institutes and funders on initiatives designed to encourage, support and reward data scientists in
  biomedical research, and drive better collaboration across UK biomedical science (building on previous work from the MRC- funded X-NET project).

- **Goal**: To enable a supportive and sustainable culture that fully includes data scientists and accelerates the impact of data science in
  biomedicine.

## [PROMOTE](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/research-project/1/faculty-of-biological-sciences/710/biomedical-data-science-and-careers-leadership-group) - Progressing Routes and Opportunities through Mentoring, Openness, Training, and Equity for biomedical data scientists

- **Led by**: University of Leeds

- **Project overview** (in progress): 
PROMOTE will map career pathways and barriers to progression in academia and make recommendations to favour the integration of skilled biomedical
data scientists in academia and industry. Career pathways in partner organisations in other sectors will also be researched, and results will be
collated into career advice materials for data scientists, and for use with students and early career researchers in academia. Results from these
investigations will be used to inform a new mentorship programme for biomedical data scientists at relevant career stages. Alongside this, the
project will implement initiatives to encourage research and caree interactions and exchanges between academic and other sectors. Finally, steps to
increase entrepreneurship in the biomedical data science workforce.
will be taken, increasing awareness and providing effective training, and increasing the level of commercialization of academic research.
