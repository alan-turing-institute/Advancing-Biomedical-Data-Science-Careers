## Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards

Five projects are funded through the MRC Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards to explore and provide evidence on how evidence to improve how biomedical research includes, resources and recognises, high-quality data science.
Together with the Advancing Biomedical Data Science Careers project, the other funded projects part of the award are:

## [BIOMEDASA](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computational-biology-facility/biomedasa/) - Biomedical Data Science Accelerator  
- **Led by**: University of Liverpool 

- **Aim**: Make data science in biomedical research more inclusive, accessible, and impactful.

- **5 projects pillars**: 
  - Enhance: Embedding Research Training Professionals (RTPs) into NHS clinical teams, helping bridge the gap between data and care. 
  - Nurture: Creating short, accessible training sessions and events, in order to help people with little or no background in data science gain practical skills and confidence. 
  - Analyse: Reviewing Biomedical data science MSc programmes across the UK to investigate both barriers and opportunities in accessing further education.  
  - Reskill: For those seeking to switch carers and retrain in data science, they project offers mentorship opportunities and training bursaries, to better help retrain them.  
  - Inspire: Promoting data science careers to secondary school students, though hands-on and interactive programming workshops, involving LEGO robots and micro:bits.  

## [HxC](https://www.ukdri.ac.uk/hxc-healthier-science-through-collaboration) â€“ Healthier Science through Collaboration 
- **Led by**: University of Edinburgh, HDR-UK, UKDRI 

- **Aim**: Amplify the voices of interdisciplinary scientists from diverse backgrounds, with the goal of fostering positive and sustainable culture
  change by embedding good practices within research teams and organisations.

- **Goals**: 
  - Give voice to interdisciplinary scientists from all backgrounds who feel let down
  - Draw from insights of researchers, industry, patient and public representatives to challenge longstanding issues in interdisciplinary research culture
  - Develop evidence-based guidelines to improve this culture
  - Test these draft guidelines in teams from partner institutions UK DRI and Health Data Research UK
  - Integrate good research culture practices to maximise the future impact of UK biomedical data research
  - With an oversight group, early career researchers and Public and Patient Involvement and Industry Group.
  - They have a survey to collect experiences of interdisciplinary collaboration and barriers.
