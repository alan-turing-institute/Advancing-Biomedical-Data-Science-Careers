Five projects are funded through the MRC Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards to explore and provide evidence on how evidence to improve how biomedical research includes, resources and recognises, high-quality data science.
Together with the Advancing Biomedical Data Science Careers project, the other funded projects part of the award are:

## [BIOMEDASA](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computational-biology-facility/biomedasa/) - Biomedical Data Science Accelerator  
- **Led by**: University of Liverpool 

- **Aim**: Make data science in biomedical research more inclusive, accessible, and impactful.

- **5 projects pillars**: 
- Enhance: Embedding Research Training Professionals (RTPs) into NHS clinical teams, helping bridge the gap between data and care. 
- Nurture: Creating short, accessible training sessions and events, in order to help people with little or no background in data science gain practical skills and confidence. 
- Analyse: Reviewing Biomedical data science MSc programmes across the UK to investigate both barriers and opportunities in accessing further education.  
- Reskill: For those seeking to switch carers and retrain in data science, they project offers mentorship opportunities and training bursaries, to better help retrain them.  
- Inspire: Promoting data science careers to secondary school students, though hands-on and interactive programming workshops, involving LEGO robots and micro:bits.
