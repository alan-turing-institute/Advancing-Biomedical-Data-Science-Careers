Five projects are funded through the MRC Biomedical Data Science Leadership Awards to explore and provide evidence on how evidence to improve how biomedical research includes, resources and recognises, high-quality data science.
Together with the Advancing Biomedical Data Science Careers project, the other funded projects part of the award are:

BIOMEDASA - Biomedical Data Science Accelerator  
Led by: University of Liverpool 

Aim: Make data science in biomedical research more inclusive, accessible, and impactful.

5 projects pillars: 

* Enhance: We’ll embed Research Training Professionals (RTPs) into NHS clinical teams, helping bridge the gap between data and care. 
* Nurture: We’re creating short, accessible training sessions and events, in order to help people with little or no background in data science gain practical skills and confidence. 
* Analyse: By reviewing Biomedical data science MSc programmes across the UK, we’ll investigate both barriers and opportunities in accessing further education.  
* Reskill: For those seeking to switch carers and retrain in data science, we’ll offer mentorship opportunities and training bursaries, to better help retrain them.  
* Inspire: We’ll promote data science careers to secondary school students, though hands-on and interactive programming workshops, involving LEGO robots and micro:bits.
