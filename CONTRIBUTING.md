In this repository, we use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) that help us recognise all contributors, even when they don't directly contribute on the repository.
You can find all [emoji/Type keywords](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) representing the types of contribution. 

To add a contributor, comment on Issue or Pull Request (where the contributor is involved) using this message for @all-contributors:
`@all-contributors please add @<username> for <keyword in the Type column>`

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](../../issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](../../pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you‚Äôve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn‚Äôt have to represent finished work. It‚Äôs usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a ‚ÄúWIP‚Äù (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
as long as you provide attribution (give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, 
and indicate if changes were made) in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the 
licensor endorses you or your use, and with no additional restrictions.
<!--Replace these sentences to appropriate reflect the license chosen in your project-->
